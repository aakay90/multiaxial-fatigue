# Modified Wu–Hu–Song (`MWHS`)

> **Registry name:** `MWHS` (and `MWHS_ext`) · **Catalogue entry:** [N28](../../METHODS.md#n28) ·
> **Source:** Wu, Li, Fang & Song (2017), <https://doi.org/10.1177/0954406217708214> ·
> **Implementation:** [`cp_methods/mwhs.py`](../../src/multifat/models/cp_methods/mwhs.py)

## Overview

- **Type and family:** strain-based critical-plane parameter that combines the Fatemi–Socie and
  Smith–Watson–Topper ideas.
- **Idea:** on the plane of maximum shear strain, the shear strain amplitude, which drives shear
  cracking, is added to an SWT-like normal term, $\sqrt{\sigma_{n,\max}\Delta\varepsilon_n/E}$, which
  drives tensile opening. The normal term is weighted by $\tfrac12(1 + \sigma_{n,\max}/\sigma_y)$.
  This replaces the life-dependent weight $k$ of the earlier WHS parameter, so that only torsional
  fatigue properties are needed.
- **Proposed for:** low-cycle multiaxial fatigue of the Ni-based superalloy GH4169 under
  proportional and non-proportional tension–torsion. It is also applied to pure titanium,
  titanium BT9, S45C steel and 1045 steel.
- **Status:** implemented for the declared repository scope. Eq. (19) was checked on the paper,
  and Fig. 14 is reproduced (see [Verification](#verification-and-limitations)). The life
  comparisons of the paper are figures only.

## Original formulation

Wu et al. (2017, Eq. 19):

```math
\frac{\Delta\gamma_{\max}}{2} + \frac12\left(1 + \frac{\sigma_{n,\max}}{\sigma_y}\right)
\left(\frac{\sigma_{n,\max}\,\Delta\varepsilon_n}{E}\right)^{0.5}
= \frac{\tau_f'}{G}(2N_f)^{b_0} + \gamma_f'(2N_f)^{c_0},
```

evaluated on the maximum shear strain plane, where:

- $\Delta\gamma_{\max}/2$ is the maximum engineering shear strain amplitude;
- $\sigma_{n,\max}$ and $\Delta\varepsilon_n$ are the maximum normal stress and the normal strain
  range on that plane;
- $\sigma_y$ is the yield strength.

The earlier WHS parameter, Eq. (13), weighted the normal term by a constant $k$. Eq. (18) shows
that $k$ must vary with life (Fig. 12); the paper suggests 0.6 for GH4169. The modification removes
$k$.

## Repository implementation

On every candidate plane (normal = local $z$ axis):

```math
\mathrm{DP} = \gamma_a + \frac12\left(1 + \frac{\sigma_{n,\max}}{S_y}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{n,\max}\,\Delta\varepsilon_n}{E}},
\qquad \sigma_{n,\max} = \max(\sigma_{n,m} + \sigma_{n,a}, 0).
```

DP is dimensionless.

- `MWHS`: DP on the plane of largest shear strain range; among tied planes, the larger DP.
- `MWHS_ext`: the largest DP over all planes. This is a repository variant.

**Repository choices**

- *Out-of-phase shear range.* The longest chord of the shear-strain path
  (`np_shear_rule = "longest_chord"`). With it, the maximum shear strain plotted in Fig. 14(a) is
  reproduced at every phase angle; the `rss` rule is not.
- *Compression clipped.* $\sigma_{n,\max} < 0$ is set to 0. The square root needs a non-negative
  product, and a compressed plane then carries no normal term.
- *Monotonic yield strength and elastic strains.* The workbook `Sy` is used for $\sigma_y$, and
  strains are elastic. The source applies the parameter to measured elastic–plastic strains in the
  low-cycle regime.
- *Life.* The shared master curve replaces the torsional Coffin–Manson curve of Eq. (19)
  ([README](README.md#from-damage-parameter-to-life-the-master-curve)).

## Material constants and inputs

| Symbol | Python / workbook name | Unit | Source | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\sigma_y$ | `Sy` / Summary yield strength | MPa | workbook | yes, $> 0$ |
| $E$, $\nu$ | `E`, `nu` / Summary | MPa, – | workbook | yes |
| $\boldsymbol\sigma(t)$ | `S_mean`, `S_sin`, `S_cos` | MPa | Dataset sheet | yes |

## Calibration

MWHS has no fitted criterion constant; this is its stated advantage over WHS. In the source, the
torsional Coffin–Manson constants $\tau_f'$, $b_0$, $\gamma_f'$, $c_0$ give the life. The repository
fits the master curve $A$, $b$ on the uniaxial R = -1 design tests instead.

With elastic strains, the uniaxial parameter on the 45° plane is

```math
\mathrm{DP} = (1+\nu)\frac{\sigma_a}{E} + \frac12\left(1 + \frac{\sigma_a}{2S_y}\right)\frac{\sigma_a}{E}\sqrt{\frac{1-\nu}{2}},
```

and the torsional parameter is $\mathrm{DP} = 2(1+\nu)\tau_a/E$. The implied torsion-to-tension
limit ratio therefore depends on $\sigma_a/S_y$.

## Worked example

GH4169 elastic constants and yield strength (paper's Table 3) with $\nu = 0.3$; synthetic loads.

```python
import numpy as np

from multifat.models.registry import get_models
from multifat.planes.sampling import build_R_list

E, nu, Sy = 198500.0, 0.3, 1083.1  # MPa, -, MPa: GH4169 E and sigma_y (paper's Table 3)
mwhs = get_models(["MWHS"])[0]
params = {"Sy": Sy, "E": E, "nu": nu}
planes = build_R_list(n1=20, n2=40)
zero = np.zeros((3, 3))


def hooke(S):
    """Isotropic linear-elastic strain tensor (tensorial shear components)."""
    return ((1 + nu) * S - nu * np.trace(S) * np.eye(3)) / E


def evaluate(S_sin, S_cos=zero):
    """MWHS and MWHS_ext of S(t) = S_sin sin(wt) + S_cos cos(wt), elastic strains."""
    result = mwhs.evaluate_case(
        S0=S_sin, S1=-S_sin, E0=hooke(S_sin), E1=-hooke(S_sin), params=params, R_list=planes,
        harmonics={"S_mean": zero, "S_sin": S_sin, "S_cos": S_cos,
                   "E_sin": hooke(S_sin), "E_cos": hooke(S_cos)},
    )  # fmt: skip
    return result.values[""], result.values["_ext"]


s_a, t_a = 600.0, 400.0
tension, tension_ext = evaluate(np.diag([s_a, 0.0, 0.0]))
torsion_tensor = np.zeros((3, 3))
torsion_tensor[0, 1] = torsion_tensor[1, 0] = t_a
torsion, _ = evaluate(torsion_tensor)

# 45 deg plane in tension: gamma_a = (1+nu) s/E, sigma_n,max = s/2, d_eps_n = (1-nu) s/E
hand = (1 + nu) * s_a / E + 0.5 * (1 + s_a / 2 / Sy) * (s_a / E) * np.sqrt((1 - nu) / 2)
assert abs(tension - hand) < 1e-9 * hand
# torsion: gamma_a = tau/G on the plane of tau_xy, no normal stress there
assert abs(torsion - 2 * (1 + nu) * t_a / E) < 1e-9 * torsion

# 90 deg out-of-phase tension-torsion, sigma_a = 2 tau_a
oop, oop_ext = evaluate(np.diag([400.0, 0.0, 0.0]), 200.0 * (torsion_tensor / t_a))

print(f"MWHS tension 600 MPa: {tension:.6f} (MWHS_ext {tension_ext:.6f})")
print(f"MWHS torsion 400 MPa: {torsion:.6f}")
print(f"MWHS 90 deg out of phase: {oop:.6f} (MWHS_ext {oop_ext:.6f})")
```

Output:

```text
MWHS tension 600 MPa: 0.005071 (MWHS_ext 0.005556)
MWHS torsion 400 MPa: 0.005239
MWHS 90 deg out of phase: 0.004571 (MWHS_ext 0.004571)
```

In tension, `MWHS_ext` finds a larger DP on a plane closer to the load axis than the 45° plane of
maximum shear strain, as for [FS](FS.md) and [MKBM](MKBM.md).

**On a supplied workbook:**

```bash
uv run multifat-pipeline --material Al7075_T6 --models MWHS --all-variants --results-dir Results/current/guides
```

## Comparison capabilities and outputs

- **Life:** master curve (`Nf_expected`), not the torsional strain–life curve.
- **DP comparison:** supported. DP is not homogeneous in the load, so use `Error_load` to compare
  with other methods.
- **`_ext`:** available; maximum DP over planes.

## Verification and limitations

[`tests/methods/test_mwhs.py`](../../tests/methods/test_mwhs.py) checks Fig. 14 for the GH4169 test
with $\varepsilon_a = 0.612$ %, $\gamma_a = 0.88$ %, $\sigma_a = 788.6$ MPa and $\tau_a = 404$ MPa.
The evaluation uses the measured strain amplitudes, $\nu = 0.48$ (Table 3) and the stresses of
the test:

- (a), the maximum shear strain amplitude, is reproduced within 2 % at all seven phase angles,
  0°–90°;
- (b), the normal term of Eq. (19), is reproduced within 5 % from 0° to 75°. At 90° the
  evaluation gives 0.0039 against 0.0049 read from the figure; this is unresolved and kept as a
  strict expected failure.

The module also checks the uniaxial and torsional closed forms with elastic strains, and the
clipping of compression.

Not reproduced: the life correlations of Figs. 15–19, which are figures only and use measured
elastic–plastic strains and the torsional Coffin–Manson curve.

Limitations:

- elastic strains on the workbooks, while the parameter was proposed for low-cycle fatigue;
- monotonic instead of cyclic yield strength.
