# Public external implementations and code leads

Generated from the external-source records in [catalogue/methods.json](catalogue/methods.json). Search/check date: 15 October 2026. Availability and limited static inspection are not equation verification, successful execution, predictive validation or permission to reuse. No third-party code was copied, translated, executed or integrated.

## Search coverage and meaning

| Counted catalogue method/scoped records searched | Confirmed corresponding/bounded-variant source | Possible or related source | No accessible source identified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 117 | 6 | 10 | 101 |

The 117 records are not a definitive count of independent theories. Two additional future workstreams, C04/ECP and C09/random-spectrum HCF, have confirmed author-associated source links and are reported separately, not added to the 117-method denominator. Other noncounted leads were not individually searched.

Confirmed means an accessible file and a traceable, explicitly bounded method correspondence were inspected. Possible includes related variants, supporting helpers, a command interface without numerical-kernel inspection, documented software without public source, and an inaccessible archive lead. One record can have several sources; confirmed takes precedence for the per-method count. No source found is a limited search outcome, not proof of absence. Source-code availability never changes WG4.3 implementation or validation status.

## License and scope gate

Six source projects offer potentially useful licensed current-scope implementations or supporting helpers: FS-Sol, FI-Sol, openfat, FLife, Fatlab and fatpack. ECP is a seventh licensed project for future geometry/gradient work. These are project counts, not numbers of independently validated laws. GPLv3/GPLv2-or-later, MIT and ISC have different obligations. The WG4.3 repository still has no selected software license: no integration is pre-approved, and license compatibility, notices and exact file scope must be reviewed before adaptation or redistribution. Unknown-license ASU repositories are reference-only pending permission. Public visibility or a copyright/citation notice is not a reuse grant.

The current FABER phase is CA fatigue of plain/smooth geometries without explicit notches, cracks or significant gradients. Existing FE wrappers can sometimes supply point kernels, but that does not import geometry processing into this scope. FLife’s COIN-LiWI kernel uses complex amplitude spectra; its spectral Carpinteri–Spagnoli variant is not a replacement for the original CA plane construction. ASU’s 2006 strain-based and 2020 energy sources must not be substituted for differently cited catalogue laws.

| Tests / scientific evidence | README cites original model and arXiv 2106.02128; MATLAB model and constant/random case listings inspected. Hard-coded material ratio in Fatigue_Model_D.m needs review; no execution or equation audit. |

| Formulation / loading / geometry | _coin_liwi uses complex tensor amplitude spectra; unlike most package methods it is not PSD-only. A harmonic smooth-point adapter may fit current scope, but means, spectrum normalization and wrapper behavior require tests. |
| Tests / scientific evidence | eq_stress.coin_liwi cites Schmidt and Kraft original paper. Package contains tests/multiaxial_test.py and comparison notebooks; not run here and coverage of this exact kernel not established. |
| Potential use and limitations | High-value kernel/reference candidate, not wholesale spectral-framework adoption. Independently verify branch handling and wrapper output before reuse. |

## Search method and unresolved leads

The [query register](research/external-code-search.json) records one named source-code query per counted record, with targeted stronger searches and citation/repository chaining for useful leads. GitHub, GitLab, MathWorks File Exchange, SourceForge, author/research sites, Zenodo and publication-linked software were screened. Useful links were checked against primary repository metadata, actual files, documentation and license notices. Generic matches and homonyms were rejected. This is a targeted first pass, not exhaustive code indexing or a saturation claim.

PragTic provides valuable author documentation but public solver source/reuse rights were not established. A historical source-on-request statement is not an open-source license. The inspected FatPy repository was empty: an implementation Issue is not source code. MathWorks LoadPathMATLAB visualizes FE load flow, not the fatigue Moment of Load Path law; sports/physiological fatigue repositories were rejected. Zenodo modified-Findley archive files could not be opened and remain unverified. The current official Code_Aster GitLab page returned a loading shell; a historical GitHub mirror exposed the command interface, not an audited standalone numerical kernel.

Recommendations: first compare proportional FS/Findley against the author MATLAB algorithms; specify source-faithful Crossland/Sines with openfat as a checked-but-unvalidated comparator; investigate the MIT COIN-LiWI kernel and its wrapper independently; ask for permission before porting ASU G35 or its data. Preserve ECP for a future geometry extension. Do not change method validation/completeness solely from this inventory. No live method Issues exist; relevant prepared briefs now point here, and actual Issues should inherit these references when posted.
